## Welcome to my site !

My name is **Noah Balencourt**, I am a French engineering student at École Centrale de Lyon in France. When I entered this school, I discovered computer science, specifically **cybersecurity** which I am now passionate about. 

Today, I know that I want to **professionnalize** myself in cybersecurity, so I wrote this site in order to display my personnal work on these topics. I have especially worked on [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org) since I started learning cybersecurity, meeting the challenges offered by the website. However, I also started to learn **networking fundamentals** in order to prepare myself to get experience of security audits, potentially during internship. I will write on this subject later on. 

## About me

I grew up in a small town near **Paris** with my parents, my little brother and my two little sisters. I went to a military high school named *Lycée militaire de Saint-Cyr*, next to Versailles, where I built strong friendships and learnt values such as camaraderie and respect for others. After high school, I went to *Lycée Saint-Louis* in Paris, where I spent 2 years of intensive preparatory course for national competitive exams to highly selective engineering Grandes Écoles. There, I followed the cursus **MPSI** (Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Sciences) in first year and **MP*** (Mathematics and Physics) in second year. After the exams, I joined the *École Centrale de Lyon* because of its long period of common courses which allowed me to find the subject that interests me the most. Thanks to this cursus, I am now sure that I want to work in the field of cybersecurity.

I also like video games, music and cinema but my passion is basket-ball, which I have been practicing since I was 10 years old. Basket-ball taught me team spirit and to surpass myself. 

I hope this site will give you a clear vision of who I am and how I work.
