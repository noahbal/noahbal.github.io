Welcome to my site !

My name is **Noah Balencourt**, I am a French engineering student at École Centrale de Lyon in France. When I entered this school after a preparatory class for Grandes Écoles, I discovered computer science, specifically **cybersecurity** which I am now passionate about. 

Today, I know that I want to **professionnalize** myself in cybersecurity, so I wrote this site in order to display my personnal work on these topics. I have especially worked on [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org) since I started learning cybersecurity, meeting the challenges offered by the website. However, I also started to learn **networking fundamentals** in order to prepare myself to get experience of security audits, potentially during internship. I will write on this subject later on. 

Personnally, I grew up in a small town near **Paris** with my parents, my little brother and my two little sisters. I went to a military high school, next to Versailles, where I built strong friendships and learnt values such as camaraderie and respect for others. My passion is basket-ball, which I have practiced since I am 10 years old, but I also like video games, music and cinema.

I hope this site will give you a clear vision of who I am and how I work.
